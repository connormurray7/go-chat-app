# Go chat
Go chat is a simple chat program that can be run from the terminal. It uses websockets to communicate between the client and server. This is my first experience using Go and the starting point was [this tutorial](https://scotch.io/bar-talk/build-a-realtime-chat-server-with-go-and-websockets).

# Install
